what i want it to start out as ... 

- map 
    -- places 
        --- reachable 
        --- unreachable / outta service areas
            ---- will not go  
            ---- will go 
            ---- can go dont go 
            ---- can go wont go 
        --- favourites list for easy access and stuff 
    -- routes 
        --- algo used -> dijkstra / A* ?? industry standards and stuff -> something new on LeetCode I saw a few days back (aug2025) ?
        --- edge cases -> whats the best place to drop off 

        --- give estimates to the users -> rider and the driver 
        --- figure the drop locations near the destinations 

        --- surge prices ? rush hours
        --- ride status sharing ?? 
        --- carpooling and stuff 
        --- season and stufff (lolllll)
    -- simulate 
        --- traffic - rush hours
        --- demand - price surges 
        --- worse routes (class of route) -> adding weights and the current traffic cause by other drivers and stuff ... can be done randomly and updatesd for like every 7min or 5kms (whateveres less)

    -- edge cases probably 
        --- destinations that do not have a well established or proper route 
        --- no drivers nearby (damn... offer higher price quote... for driver comp)
        --- no riders nearby (give alert to driver to move lol)

- entities 
    -- drivers
        --- status -> offline , idle , engaged , riding 
        --- rating -> 1-10
        --- history -> rides+fares , earning-breakdown 
    -- riders 
        --- find ride 
            ---- driver and choice of vehicles 
            ---- based on incereasing distances - graph algo on the map used 
            ---- payment options - fix once started / driver consent needed when changing
        --- rating -> 1-10
        --- history
            ---- ride details , payment view link 

- prompts for rider and the driver 
    -- ride updates and statuses 
    -- price details 
    -- weather and construction alerts -> other issues as well 
    --  

- atomic payments gateway and settlements 
    -- cash 
        --- rider confirms -> completed / issue -> customer update ledger
    -- card 
        --- rider and save regulated card details for customer
    -- digital 
        --- transaction id and mode -> completed or raise issues
